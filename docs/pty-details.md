I must admit, I don't know all the details of how the PTY works.
I tried to read through [reptyr](https://github.com/nelhage/reptyr)
and [its blog post](https://blog.nelhage.com/2011/02/changing-ctty/)
but there are many details I don't fully understand.
These things are however probably relevant for this project,
so here I will collect some summary.

Specifically, what I don't understand:

- What is a [pseudoterminal (PTY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal)?
  How does it work?
- What is a "controlling terminal", or the "current controlling terminal (CTTY)"?
- What are "sessions groups" and "process groups"?
- What is a "session leader" or "process group leader"?
- What do [setsid](https://linux.die.net/man/2/setsid), [setpgid](https://linux.die.net/man/2/setpgid), etc do?
- Can you change the parent process?
- What does `disown` do? `nohup`? When do you get `SIGHUP`?
- What is `PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER`? What is a "child subreaper" of a process?

Some comments, summary:

PTY has two endpoints:
- Master/server. This is the terminal emulator (e.g. xterm).
- Slave/client. E.g. a shell (e.g. bash).

Termios sits between the master/slave PTY endpoints.
Termios is implemented in the kernel. 
Termios controls all the logic of the PTY.

SIGHUP: controlling terminal closed.

Parent of a process is actually not really relevant?
When the parent dies (e.g. the shell),
the child process is reparented automatically (e.g. to `init`)
and continues to run (unless it now crashes due to SIGHUP or pipe destroyed).
So we maybe don't need to care about proper reparenting,
and simply need to care about proper PTY and stdin/stdout/stderr setup.
